# Session Alive
This add-on is used to keep the session alive for any website. Install and forget the session timeout messages.

### Purpose

Session Timeout is great for Production websites, but not for Development and Testing. There are great add-ons for reloading webpages, but what about a "set it and forget it" solution?

## Quick start

Get started creating a new **[Foreground Auto-Reload Rule](#foreground-request-options)** with 1 minute interval.

Navigate to the Trigger URL in a new tab.
